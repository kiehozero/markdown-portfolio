I'm currently learning UI/UX after picking up **HTML** and **CSS**. After my *first* project using these I'll be adding **JavaScript**, **Node.JS** and **Python** for the *second* project. My back-end capabilities will be **Python** and **Django**, as well as **MySQL** and **MongoDB**, which will be displayed in my *third* and *fourth* projects in 2021. I have previously used client-side **SQL** as a data analyst using **PowerBI** and cube functions within Excel, where I also picked up some **VBA**. Long-term I would like to be a back-end data specialist, picking up **Agile** and **Ruby** to create powerful data analysis applications.
